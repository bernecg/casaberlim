# CASA BERLIM

![alt tag](https://github.com/bernecg/casaberlim/blob/1.0/webapp/apple-touch-icon.png)

Webapp created to members of Casa Berlim. And a way to me to study UI5 libraries.
Also to study a little bit of making websites, learning a little of Javascript and PHP.
Any suggestion is totally accepted :)
